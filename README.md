# Employee Attrition AI Platform

An industry-grade AI platform that predicts employee attrition and explains decisions using modern AI techniques.
This project demonstrates how real organizations build **reliable, explainable, and monitored AI systems**.

---

## Business Problem

Employee attrition is costly and disruptive.
The goal of this platform is to identify employees at risk of leaving **early enough to act**, while minimizing unnecessary HR interventions.

Key priorities:
- Missing a leaving employee is very costly
- False alarms are acceptable
- Explanations must be human-readable
- Models must be monitored after deployment

---

## What This Platform Includes

- Feature engineering at scale
- Business-aware machine learning
- Cost-sensitive decision logic
- Model monitoring and drift detection
- LLM-powered explanations
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Hybrid ML + LLM architecture
- Production-style project structure

---

## High-Level Architecture

1. Raw HR data is transformed using feature engineering
2. ML models predict attrition risk
3. Business rules adjust decisions based on cost
4. Monitoring detects performance or data drift
5. LLMs explain predictions in natural language
6. RAG answers HR questions using company documents
7. APIs expose predictions and explanations

---

## Tech Stack (Planned)

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- FastAPI
- LLM APIs (OpenAI-compatible)
- Vector database (for RAG)
- Git & GitHub
